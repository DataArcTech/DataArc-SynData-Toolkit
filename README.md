*A modular, highly user-friendly synthetic data generation toolkit supporting multi-source, multi-language data synthesis.*

### Easily synthesize training data for LLMs with zero-code [CLI](#:rocket:-Quick-Start) and [GUI](#:desktop_computer:-Synthesizing-Data-with-GUI) !

## :dart: Project Overview

**DataArc SynData Toolkit** is a synthetic data generation toolkit developed and open-sourced by DataArc. It enables users to generate customized training data in one step through simple configuration files based on their requirements.



## :bulb: Key Features

- **Extremely Simple Usage**: Synthesize data with [a single command](#3-Synthesize-Data) and a configuration file. [Gradio UI](##:desktop_computer:-Synthesizing-Data-with-GUI) is also provided for easy operations.
- **Support for Multi-Source Synthetic Data**:
  - **Local Synthesis**: Support for generating data based on local corpora.
  - **Huggingface Integration**: Automatically screens and retrieves data from Huggingface.
  - **Model Distillation**: Enable synthetic data generation through model distillation.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports English and various low-resource languages.
- **Multi-Provider Model Support**: Works with local deployment, OpenAI APIs, and more.
- **Highly Extensible**: The entire synthetic data workflow is modular, allowing developers to flexibly customize them.


## 🔬 Performance

| Model                       | Medical | Finance | Law   |
|----------------------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct       | 42.34%  | 52.91%   | 19.80% |
| Trained with Synthetic Data | 64.57%  | 73.93%  | 42.80% |

A few lines of code deliver over 20% performance improvements.

## :notebook: Changelog

[25/11/17] We open-sourced our synthetic data platform.

## :factory: DataArc SynData Toolkit Pipeline

**DataArc SynData Toolkit** is designed to synthesize data in a modular pipeline, allowing users to customize the strategies and implementation methods of each step. The main components include:

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generate data through methods such as local synthesis, Huggingface dataset retrieval, and model distillation.
  - Developers can inherit [BaseTaskConfig](./sdgsystem/configs/config.py) and [BaseTaskExecutor](./sdgsystem/tasks/base.py) to customize the generation task.
- **Data Filtering and Rewriting**: Filter and rewrite initially synthesized data according to the target model's requirements.
  - Developers can inherit [BaseRewriteConfig](./sdgsystem/configs/config.py) and [BaseRewriter](./sdgsystem/generation/rewriter.py) to customize the rewrite method for synthetic data (or no rewriting).

By decoupling modules, developers can achieve flexible customization of functional modules based on specific needs.



## :jigsaw: Use Cases

We provide [three different use cases](examples/README.md) that sythesize data through **DataArc SynData Toolkit**.

## :rocket: Quick Start

### 1. Install DataArc SynData Toolkit

```shell
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DataArcTech/DataArc-SynData-Toolkit.git
cd DataArc-SynData-Toolkit

# 2. Install uv if not already installed
pip install uv

# 3. Install dependencies 
uv sync
```

For hardware requirements and dependencies detail, please refer to [dependency and installation guide](DEPENDENCIES.md).

### 2. Configuration

Please refer to the [example configuration file](./configs/example.yaml) and modify the configuration based on your requirements.

### 3. Synthesize Data

Run through CLI: 

Create a .env file and specified the following fields.

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx   # your api key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1  # Optional: your base url
```

And run following command.

```shell
uv run sdg configs/example.yaml  # or change to your .yaml file
```

## :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Training with Synthesized Data

Prepare your synthesized data at datasets/. Here is an example of LoRA fine-tuning with gsm8k dataset on Qwen2.5-0.5B:

```shell
cd train
bash examples/sft/gsm8k/run_qwen_05_peft.sh
```

## :desktop_computer: Synthesizing Data with GUI

The UI is powered by [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio). Build with following command.

```shell
uv run python app.py
```
